# Click-d_dating_site_analysis
Analysing user behaviour at a hypothetical dating site

- The data are split into two tables. The users table gives details of users who registered on a hypothetical dating app called Click’d on 10th and 11th November. The events table shows the events carried out by these users, i.e. app start, left swipe or right swipe

- There are 100 users and the events data span five days

- This project aims to segment the data and discover patterns in user behaviour. Cohort analysis is also carried out to analyse user retention as well as an A/B test which explores a new approach relating to how users interact with the dating app

- The customer segmentation was carried out in SQL and the cohort analysis and A/B test were carried out in Python

- The Python libraries used include Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, ScyPy and Random
